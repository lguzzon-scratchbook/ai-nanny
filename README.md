# AI Nanny - Because I Couldn't Think Of A Better Name

Use the power of AI to help monitor your loved ones. This simple site allows you to connect multiple live streams using your old phones, then utilises machine learning models (COCO SSD mobilenet & tensorflow lite) to detect the presence of people appearing in the streams. When no people are detected in all views (ie. your baby is no longer visible to any camera), the page requests you attention.
